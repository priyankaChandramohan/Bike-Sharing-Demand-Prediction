# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
This repository contains a data science project long with a `project report` focused on predicting the demand for bike sales. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and analyzing historical data, this project aims to provide accurate predictions of bike sales, enabling better inventory management and decision-making for bike retailers.

The weather has a significant effect on the activities undertaken by people. Predicting the weather helps people to plan their day schedule accordingly. Whether rain will occur tomorrow or not, this is important to know in order to plan the daily activities accordingly. The rain prediction is done on the basis of various factors such as Pressure, Humidity, Temperature, Wind Direction, Wind Gust Speed etc.
-	Whether rain will happen tomorrow or not, this needs to be predicted from the dataset of the weather details of different regions of Australia.
-	Based on different factors such as Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Cloud, Wind Directions etc., the prediction of rain tomorrow can be made.

## Project Overview
The Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project involves the following steps:
- Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Analyzing the provided dataset to gain insights into the features, handling missing values, outliers, and performing necessary data transformations.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Model Development: Applying machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, or gradient boosting to build predictive models.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics and selecting the best-performing model.
- Deployment and Prediction: Deploying the chosen model to predict sales for new data points or unseen data.

## Main Goal
-	Performing an Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset to understand the data in depth and analyze the relationship among different variables.
-	Building different Machine Learning models that can predict the occurrence of rain tomorrow on the basis of various parameters such as Cloud, Humidity, Pressure etc. 
-	Analyzing the accuracy of different models and identifying which model is the most accurate for the rain prediction.

## Recommendations
-	Classification algorithms can be used to predict if there will occur rain tomorrow or not.
-	By knowing the possibility of the occurrence of the rain tomorrow, people can carry umbrellas and plan their day schedule accordingly.

## Conclusions
-	The Random Forest Model is the most accurate model for the given dataset with the accuracy of around 86%. The decision tree is not a good model for the given dataset.
-	The occurrence of the rain tomorrow does depend on whether rain occurs today or not. The other factors such as Humidity at 9 am and 3 pm, Pressures at 9 am and 3 pm, Minimum and Maximum Temperatures and Temperatures at 9 am and 3 pm also affect the occurrence of rain tomorrow.
